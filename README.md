Django Template Viewer
======================

**Template viewer panel for django-debug-toolbar.**

**Author:** Tom Christie, [Follow me on Twitter][twitter].

Overview
========

Django template viewer lets you easily inspect the template layout of your web pages.

**Note**: This package is still in a somewhat experimental stage.  I believe there may currently be some issues with it's interaction with other debug toolbar panels.  Give it a try and let me know what you think. 

Installation
============

Install using pip:

    pip install https://github.com/tomchristie/django-template-viewer/zipball/master

In your debug settings, modify your `TEMPLATE_LOADERS` setting to use `template_viewer`:

    if DEBUG:
        from template_viewer import wrap_loaders
        TEMPLATE_LOADERS = wrap_loaders(TEMPLATE_LOADERS)

Add the template viewer to your debug toolbar panels:

    DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS = (
        'debug_toolbar.panels.version.VersionDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.timer.TimerDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.settings_vars.SettingsVarsDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.headers.HeaderDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.request_vars.RequestVarsDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.sql.SQLDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.template.TemplateDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.signals.SignalDebugPanel',
        'debug_toolbar.panels.logger.LoggingPanel',
        'template_viewer.panels.TemplateViewerPanel'
    )
